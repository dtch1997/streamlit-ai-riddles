success,,palm,"I stand tall in lands where the sun is near,  
With fingers outstretched in the sky so clear.  
In shade I offer a gentle calm,  
What am I, who’s known by a single psalm?","Let's solve this riddle step by step:

1. ""I stand tall"" suggests something that grows or reaches upward
2. ""lands where the sun is near"" hints at tropical or desert regions
3. ""fingers outstretched in the sky"" suggests branches or fronds reaching upward
4. ""shade I offer"" indicates it provides cover from the sun
5. ""known by a single psalm"" could reference the simplicity of its name

Putting these clues together points to a PALM tree:
- They are iconic in tropical regions
- Their fronds look like fingers stretching to the sky
- They provide shade in hot climates 
- The word ""palm"" is simple and singular
- They are notably tall trees

success,,fear,"It's a shadow that lingers, unseen but quite near,  
Making mountains from molehills, it turns brave into mere.  
Invisible chain, often hard to steer,  
In the corner of courage, it whispers in your ear.","Let me break down this riddle:

1. ""Shadow that lingers, unseen but quite near"" suggests something intangible but ever-present
2. ""Making mountains from molehills"" indicates something that makes things seem worse than they are
3. ""Turns brave into mere"" implies it reduces courage or confidence
4. ""Invisible chain"" suggests something that restrains or holds you back
5. ""Whispers in your ear"" points to internal negative thoughts
6. ""Corner of courage"" indicates it's the opposite of bravery

All these clues point to FEAR. Fear is an invisible force that makes small problems seem bigger, can paralyze even brave people, acts like an invisible chain holding us back, and manifests as whispers of doubt in our minds.

- It describes something in the sky
- It's fierce and dragon-like
- It involves drops (suggesting rain)
- It produces flashes
- It's temporary/fleeting

success,,pride,"In the lion's heart, it's kept confined, <br/>
A feeling bold, yet sometimes blind. <br/>
It stands tall with colors high, <br/>
A walk with dignity that none can deny. <br/>","Let's analyze this riddle line by line:

""In the lion's heart, it's kept confined"" - Lions are often associated with pride and bravery
""A feeling bold, yet sometimes blind"" - This suggests something that can make one overconfident
""It stands tall with colors high"" - This hints at standing proudly, displaying oneself
""A walk with dignity that none can deny"" - Again emphasizes a dignified, proud bearing

The riddle consistently points to characteristics associated with being proud or having pride. Lions are known as proud creatures, and the riddle references both the emotional aspect (feeling) and physical manifestation (standing tall, walking with dignity) of pride. The fact that it can be ""blind"" also fits with the common phrase ""blind pride.""

success,,mauve,"In twilight's glow, a mystery hue,  
Where red meets blue in royal review,  
Whispered in gardens where shadows behave,  
Name this color that isn't quite brave.","Let's solve this riddle step by step:

1. ""Twilight's glow"" suggests a muted, in-between time of day
2. ""Red meets blue"" is a direct reference to color mixing
3. ""Royal review"" hints at regality or nobility
4. ""Isn't quite brave"" suggests something less bold or weak
5. When red and blue mix, they create purple
6. The word ""whispered"" and ""isn't quite brave"" suggests a lighter, more timid version
7. A lighter version of purple that's often seen in gardens is lavender

The answer is lavender because:
- It's a lighter purple (mix of red and blue)
- It's found in gardens
- It's a softer, less bold version of purple
- It has a twilight-like quality
- It's considered a delicate, less ""brave"" color than purple

1. The riddle describes something that creates positive emotions:
- ""spark in a child's gleeful eyes"" suggests something that brings delight
- ""warmth in a heart"" indicates a positive feeling
- ""makes spirits spring"" implies it lifts people's moods
- ""moments of triumph"" connects to feelings of achievement

2. The key clue is ""a word of three letters"" - so we're looking for a 3-letter word

1. The riddle describes something that appears in the morning (""cloak the morn"")
2. It's described as ""silvery lace"" suggesting something delicate and white/silver in color
3. It's temporary (""fleeting artist without a trace"")
4. It makes grass glimmer in the early morning (""dawn's soft glow"")
5. The key hint is that it appears in the morning and makes things glisten

These clues point to dew - the water droplets that form on cool surfaces overnight and appear in the morning, making grass and other surfaces glisten. Dew looks silvery, is temporary as it evaporates when the sun rises, and creates a delicate, lace-like appearance across the landscape in early morning.

- ""See yourself by name"" indicates it shows your own reflection/image
- ""Morning light or evening's glow"" means it works throughout the day
- ""Reveal the face you come to know"" clearly points to something that shows your reflection/face

This is describing a mirror - a common household object that shows our reflection silently, reveals our true appearance, and works any time there's light to see by. It's framed, silent, and shows us exactly as we are.

""In silence, I speak"" - This suggests something that communicates without making sound
""yet voices I hold"" - It contains or preserves what people say or express
""Carried through air"" - Can be moved around, transported
""but never grow old"" - Remains unchanged, preserves content
""A keeper of thought"" - Stores ideas and information
""in lines I reside"" - Written in lines on pages

This points to something that:
- Communicates silently
- Contains people's voices/thoughts
- Has content written in lines
- Preserves information without aging
- Can be carried around

The answer must be a ""writing"" or ""book."" But since a book preserves thoughts in written lines, contains voices (of authors), speaks silently to readers, and carries messages through time without aging, while being the more specific single word...

""In the sky I stand, reaching for height"" suggests something that:
- Exists up in the sky/air
- Is stationary (""I stand"")
- Extends upward (""reaching for height"")

This most likely refers to a MOUNTAIN, which:
- Appears to ""stand"" in the sky from our perspective
- Is a fixed, stationary natural formation
- Reaches upward toward great heights
- Literally extends from the ground up into the sky

success,,leap,"In the game of time, I'm quite unique,<br>Just once in four, I make my peak.<br>I'm a sudden move, a bold critique,<br>A change that makes the timid speak.","Let's analyze this riddle line by line:

""In the game of time"" - This suggests something related to the calendar or time measurement

""Just once in four"" - This is a key clue indicating something that happens every four years

""I'm a sudden move, a bold critique"" - Suggests something that represents change or addition

""A change that makes the timid speak"" - Implies something that causes even hesitant people to take action

Putting these clues together:
- Something that occurs every four years
- Related to time
- Represents a bold change
- Gives people extra opportunity

This points to a leap year, when we add an extra day (February 29th) every four years to keep our calendar aligned with the Earth's orbit. The ""bold move"" is adding an extra day, and it can affect timid people because those born on February 29th might need to speak up about when to celebrate their birthday in non-leap years.

2. ""voices that weave a magical spell"" - suggests singing
3. ""Drama and chorus"" - points to a combination of acting and musical performance
4. ""stories sung, a history bold"" - implies narratives being told through song

success,,envy,"In shadows of longing, I cleverly hide,","This riddle suggests something that conceals itself in a hidden or stealthy way (""I cleverly hide""), specifically in places associated with yearning or desire (""shadows of longing""). The phrase ""shadows of longing"" implies emotional darkness or unfulfilled desires. When something hides in relation to longing or desire, it often refers to unrequited feelings, particularly love that remains unexpressed or hidden.

Given that this describes something that intentionally conceals itself in emotional shadows and is associated with yearning, the most fitting answer would be ""desire"" itself - as desire often hides in the shadows of our hearts, cleverly concealing itself while still being present.
